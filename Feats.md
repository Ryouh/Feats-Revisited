# Feats Revisited
This rule set is designed to give more depth to characters over the course of their Adventures. It  contains most feats from the official sourcebooks and in addition, there are several new feats including racial feats for most official races. Some feats were changed or reworked to fit this system. The feats Advanced Weapon Adept, Blackpowder Expert and Scatter Weapon Master are meant to work with the Grim Hollow campaign setting.
  
<div style='margin-top:40px'></div>

#### Gaining Feats
  
* This rule set replaces the [optional rules for feats](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/customization-options#Feats). Characters now gain feats based on their character level. 
* Characters gain one feat at levels 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18.
  
#### Ability score improvements
  
* All ability score improvements (ASI) granted to a character by reaching levels in a class have to be taken as ASI -  you can no longer forgo them to gain another feat.
* All feats that granted increases to ability scores in the official sourcebooks no longer do so. Instead they grant other benefits.

#### Choosing a feat

* Once you reach a level that grants you a new feat, you can choose from either the general feats or from your racial feats. 
* You must meet all the prerequisites listed in the feat if you want to aquire it. 
* A feat can not be "saved up" and used later to gain a higher level one. The feat you gain at a specific level can only be picked from the feats lists up to that level (or lower) - For example:
  + You **cannot** delay picking your level 1 feat until level 3 and then aquire 2 level 3 feats.  
  + You **can** use the feat you gain at level 3 to pick a feat from the level 1 list.
* Unless otherwise stated you can’t choose a feat more than once.
