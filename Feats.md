# Feats Revisited
This version of feats is designed to give more
depth to characters over the course of their
Adventures. This guide contains all feats from
the Players Handbook and Xanathar's Guide
to Everything. In addition, there are several
new feats including feats for most official
races. Some feats were changed or reworked
to fit with this system. The feats Advanced Weapon Adept,
Blackpowder Expert and Scatter Weapon Master are
designed to work with the Grim Hollow campaign setting.

## Overview
This Rule set replaces the optional rules for feats. Instead of
forgoing an ability score improvement, characters will get
feats based on their character level, as shown in the table
below. Some of the feats will now have level requirements in
addition to their normal prerequisite.

### Feats gained
| Level | Feat |
|:---:|:--|
|  1 | 1st |
|  3 | 2nd |
|  6 | 3rd |
|  9 | 4th |
| 12 | 5th |
| 15 | 6th |
| 18 | 7th |


#### Choosing a feat

Once you reach a level, that grants you a new feat, you can
choose from either the general feats or from your racial feats.
To choose a feat you must meet all the prerequisites listed in
the feat. You can always choose lower level feats. Unless
otherwise stated you can’t choose a feat more than once.
